- If you have never heard of notpron before: It's an online puzzle game created by David MÃ¼nnich in 2004.
- I highly recommend going into it blind and trying to figure out the first few levels fully by yourself (spoilers take all of the fun out of it)

### This Repository

- **Current Progress:** Level 47 out of (140?)
- Images, audio, notes and other files pertaining to solving the notpron puzzle. The number of each folder corresponds to the level the files are from. 
This is just a backup of my personal progress.
- (don't mind the two audio files in the root folder; i just forgot to sort them in properly and forgot which level they're from)
